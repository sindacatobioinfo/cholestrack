# home/models.py
"""
Home application models.

This application serves as the central navigation hub and dashboard.
It aggregates information from other applications (profile, samples, files)
but does not typically define its own database models.

If future requirements include dashboard-specific data such as user preferences,
saved searches, or custom views, those models would be defined here.
